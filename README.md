### What I Built
For this project, I developed a microservice-based application called ArticleHub, which is aimed at efficiently managing and retrieving articles. The system is built using two core services: a reader-service and an article-service. These services work together to fetch, filter, paginate, and access articles by their unique identifiers. The entire backend is implemented in Java 17 using Spring Boot, ensuring a scalable and maintainable architecture.

### Key Features:

Feign Client Communication: I utilized Feign to simplify REST communication between the reader-service and article-service. This abstraction allows the services to interact seamlessly without the need to write boilerplate HTTP client code.

Advanced Filtering: Users can filter articles based on various attributes like category, tags, and publication dateâ€”making it easy to locate relevant content.

Efficient Pagination: To manage large datasets, pagination has been incorporated into article fetching, enhancing performance and user experience.

Direct Access via ID: Articles can be accessed using their unique IDs, allowing quick retrieval of specific pieces of content.

Microservice Design: The application follows a modular, microservice-based architecture where each service is independently deployable, testable, and scalable.

### Tech Stack:

Spring Boot: For creating and managing microservices.

Feign: As the HTTP client for inter-service communication.

Java 17: Backend development language.

Maven: For project build and dependency management.

### Development Challenges:

A notable challenge was maintaining clean and robust communication between services using Feign. I addressed this by clearly documenting all interfaces, handling exceptions properly, and adhering to best practices in microservice design.

Future Enhancements:
Integrate authentication and authorization to secure article access.

Add caching for frequently requested articles to improve performance.

Extend article-service functionality to support article creation and editing.

ArticleHub reflects my commitment to building scalable and maintainable systems while showcasing the effectiveness of microservices and declarative HTTP communication using Feign.
